# nitro conditions

These are the T&C's to my Nitro Giveaways.

Pretty simple:

- Don't ask

Seriously, don't ask for nitro. If you ask I **will not** give it to you.
I only give nitro to people who don't ask.

- Don't push

Same as rule 1. If you push (i.e. *"it would be nice if someone gave me nitro"*), I will pull up a scam link bc u broke dis one (jk, I'll just say no)

- Don't ask for an extension/upgrade

The nitro I will give you is ***Classic*** **for** ***1 Month*** only.
No exceptions.

- The "Roasted" Rule

If I roast you because of the nitro, I have to give it to you just because.

Yes, this is literally a loophole.

- Don't tell

Actually, tell anyone you like, just... make sure they know about these terms.
